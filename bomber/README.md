# Bomber

logic to control horizons (or other units) with an arc to suicide on the enemy base and explode

blocks: arc, 2 sorters, memcell, overdrive-projector, 3 processors

materials: phase from core, titanium for cryofluid, 1 flare

- unitcontroller - move the units into place and let them aim - preferrably hyper
- loader - let the units pick up explosives from core - will work on any size, but slower with more units
- logiccontroller, phasedelivery - configure the memcell to the needed ulookup - deliver phase when needed into the overdrive - disable arc and proc1 when it isnt needed
