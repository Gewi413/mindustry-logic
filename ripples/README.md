# Ripples

logic to control and fuel ripples (or other turrets) with a flare to quickly push enemy bases

blocks: switch, overdrive-projector, 6 turrets, 3 procesors

materials: phase from core, plastanium from core, 7 flare

- ammo - will resupply the turrets with ammo
- controller - will make the turrets shoot where the player aims
- phase - will supply phase for overdrive and free up the flares afterwards
